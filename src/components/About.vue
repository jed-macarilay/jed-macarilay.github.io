                I am Self-taught Developer
              </div>
              I've been doing web development since 2018 and have been part of many projects in different industries such as outsourcing, banking, freelancing, and the food industry. My expertise spans both front-end and back-end development. For the front-end, I use Vue js. On the back-end, I work with PHP, Laravel, and MySQL, and I'm also knowledgeable in using CodeIgniter. Currently, I am expanding my skill set by learning React js, Node js, Tailwind, and MongoDB.
